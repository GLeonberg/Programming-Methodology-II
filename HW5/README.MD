Binary Tree and HeapInsert are not fully functional programs, merely code to answer questions.

To run heapsort, simply navigate to the directory of the file and run:

"python heapsort.py" (ignoring quotes)

in the terminal

The dataset files MUST be in the same directory as the python source code.
(See HW3 for dataset files, or subsitute your own datasets by changing the file names in the source code)
